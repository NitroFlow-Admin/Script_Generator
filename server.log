But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge.

Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1.

No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn\'t optimized to capture and convert, you\'re leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you\'re missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you\'re slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you\'re handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn\'t optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you\'re not guiding visitors to take action, you\'re missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n\nLocations: Utah\nCompany Facts: Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.

But for many freight brokers and logistics professionals, it’s actually a silent deal-breaker. If your site isn't optimized to capture and convert, you're leaving shipper and carrier leads on the table.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top freight website mistakes we see—and how to fix them to start converting more traffic into real business.\r\n\r\n1. No CRM Integration\r\nLeads shouldn’t just land in your inbox—they should flow directly into your freight CRM. Without CRM integration, you're missing automation, visibility, and timely follow-up. Every form submission should trigger lead scoring, automated emails, task creation, and contact tracking.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight website platform like SalesDrip that embeds lead forms and syncing logic into every page.\r\n\r\n2. Generic Contact Forms\r\nA single “Contact Us” form isn’t enough. You need tailored forms for shippers, carriers, and agents—each designed to capture the right info. If you’re only asking for name and email, you’re wasting qualified traffic.\r\n\r\nSolution: Create separate, conversion-optimized forms for each audience. Use custom fields that plug into your CRM workflows.\r\n\r\n3. No Digital Document Tools\r\nIf your onboarding still depends on email chains and PDFs, you're slowing down the process—and giving your competitors an edge. Freight deals often stall when document exchange becomes manual.\r\n\r\nSolution: Include digital signing for NDAs, broker-carrier agreements, and onboarding packets—right on your website.\r\n\r\n4. Missing Carrier and Shipper Portals\r\nShippers and carriers expect self-service. If they can’t log in, check their load status, or upload documents, they’ll find someone else who makes it easy. This is especially true if you're handling repeat volume or contract lanes.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add secure login portals to your site that sync with your carrier CRM and shipper CRM to streamline ongoing communication.\r\n\r\n5. Slow Load Times and Mobile Issues\r\nA fast, mobile-optimized website isn't optional—it’s required. If your site takes more than 2–3 seconds to load or doesn’t work smoothly on mobile, Google will penalize you and users will bounce.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use a freight-optimized website built for speed and responsive design. Compress assets, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and test using Google PageSpeed Insights.\r\n\r\n6. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\r\nToo many freight websites bury the CTA—or don’t have one at all. If you're not guiding visitors to take action, you're missing the entire point of having a site.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use strong, visible CTAs like “Request a Quote,” “Book a Demo,” or “Sign Up Now.” Place them above the fold and throughout key sections.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nYour freight website is either gaining you leads—or losing them silently. By avoiding these common mistakes and building with freight-first strategy, you’ll increase conversions, build trust, and close more business.\r\n\r\nSalesDrip helps freight brokers and freight agents build high-converting websites integrated with automation, CRM, and onboarding tools—all purpose-built for the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nThird Party Integrations\r\nSalesDrip integrates with top apps like Zapier, Gmail, QuickBooks, Zoom, and many more!\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nQuickbooks\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nZapier\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nGmail\r\n\r\nintegrationIcon\r\nOpenAI ChatGPT\r\n\r\n", 'locations': 'Utah', 'facts': "Freight Broker CRM & Automation Software Built by Industry Veterans\r\nSalesDrip is the all-in-one freight broker CRM and freight automation software built by professional brokers who started, scaled, and sold multiple freight brokerages.
